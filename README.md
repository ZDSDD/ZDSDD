### Hello there, I'm Sebastian Sadowy 👋

 - 🎮 I've done some simple games, currently trying AI in UE5
 - 🍃 I'm learning Spring at the moment. So much boilerplate in Java... damn 
 - 🏃‍♀️ I tried Go and I must say it's super cool
 - 🐧 I must say it. I enjoy Linux. I start to enjoy VIM again
 - 🎶 I love listening to Music & Ambience from games I played
 - 🌱 TODO:
   * Kubernetes
   * More web backend stuff
